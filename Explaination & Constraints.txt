Explaination: 
The picture is based on bitstring (0/1) where 1 shows high intensity pixel and 0 shows low intensity pixel. The algorithm is self designed, it gives a simple demonstration of usage of KNN for image restoration.

Constraints:
The Window size is 3 (K=3) becuase it appears illogical to check with far neighbours for recovering an image's pixel.
